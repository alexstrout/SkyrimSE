No Disarm (Unequip Instead)
------
Tired of looking for disarmed weapons? You're in luck! Disarms are replaced by a simple unequip.

[h1][u]Skyrim Special Edition Note[/u][/h1]
[b]This will eventually make its way to SSE - I'll update this section when it does!
As it would not rely on SKSE64, it should be compatible with all platforms.[/b]

[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
Changes all vanilla "Disarm" type MagicEffects to "Stagger" type instead.
An attached lightweight script then simply unequips the target's weapon(s) and/or shield.

NPCs usually re-equip the "disarmed" weapons after the stagger, but sometimes they switch it up.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't also mess with vanilla Disarm MGEFs.

[h1]Uninstall Steps[/h1]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.

EnaiSiaion's Wildcat - Combat of Skyrim:

No Disarm's unequip was directly inspired by Wildcat's disarm functionality.
However, I noticed Wildcat did not affect vanilla Disarms, so I made this plugin.
Also, Wildcat is dope.
