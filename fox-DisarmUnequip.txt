No Disarm (Unequip Instead)
------
Tired of looking for disarmed weapons? You're in luck! Disarms are replaced by a simple unequip.
------
Simply a port of my recent-ish plugin from original Skyrim. Enjoy!

[b]Original Non-SE Version - Steam Workshop (1.0.0)[/b]

[b]Additional Information[/b]
Changes all vanilla "Disarm" type MagicEffects to "Stagger" type instead.
An attached lightweight script then simply unequips the target's weapon(s) and/or shield.

NPCs usually re-equip the "disarmed" weapons after the stagger, but sometimes they switch it up.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't also mess with vanilla Disarm MGEFs.
However, any mods that add Disarm effects will need to be patched to reflect these changes.

[b]Uninstall Steps[/b]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.

No Disarm's unequip was directly inspired by Wildcat's arm injury "disarm" functionality.
However, I noticed Wildcat did not affect vanilla Disarms, so I made this plugin.
Also, Wildcat is dope.
