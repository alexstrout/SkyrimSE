Spell: Write Spell Tome
------
Implements the ability to write spell tomes from equipped spells in exchange for a Dragon Soul.

Simply a port of my 2018 plugin from original Skyrim. Enjoy!

[b]Original Non-SE Version - Steam Workshop (1.0.0)[/b]

[b]Requirements[/b]
Requires SKSE64: [url=https://skse.silverlock.org]https://skse.silverlock.org[/url]

[b]Usage[/b]
Equip the Lesser Power "Write Spell Tome" in either hand, and a desired spell in the other hand.
After casting, the spell tome teaching that spell (if one exists) will appear in your inventory.

A Dragon Soul will be spent if a spell tome was successfully written; otherwise, nothing happens.

[b]Additional Information[/b]
Intended to be used with MFSTL to distribute otherwise unique, one-time spell tomes to followers:

However, this could just be used on its own if you otherwise had some use for writing spell tomes.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
Currently, only vanilla / DLC spell tomes are supported.
However, for the merge-savvy, the FLST of supported Books is "1foxFollowSpellTomeList".
Simply add any spell tomes you'd like this mod to support to this list.

[b]Uninstall Steps[/b]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.
