Spell: Write Spell Tome
------
Implements the ability to write spell tomes from equipped spells in exchange for a Dragon Soul.
------
Simply a port of my 2018 plugin from original Skyrim, now with some enhanced features. Enjoy!

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color]
Requires SKSE64: [url=https://skse.silverlock.org]https://skse.silverlock.org[/url]

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Usage[/size][/color]
Equip the Lesser Power "Write Spell Tome" in either hand, and a desired spell in the other hand.
After casting, the spell tome teaching that spell (if one exists) will appear in your inventory.

To write dual-cast-only spells (e.g. Master spells), equip them within 5 seconds of casting.

A Dragon Soul will be spent if a spell tome was successfully written; otherwise, nothing happens.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Additional Information[/size][/color]
Intended to be used with MFSTL to distribute otherwise unique, one-time spell tomes to followers:

However, this could just be used on its own if you otherwise had some use for writing spell tomes.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]
Compatible with all vanilla / DLC spell tomes.
Compatible with any spell mod that adds spell tomes to vendor "LItemSpellTomesXXSchool" lists.
(This likely includes any popular spell mod.)

For the merge-savvy, the FLST of supported Books is "1foxFollowSpellTomeList".
If a particular spell tome isn't being found by the mod, try adding it to this list in a patch.
[i]However, please remake any 1.x.x compatibility patches you may have made.[/i]

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Uninstall Steps[/size][/color]
Simply unequip Write Spell Tome (if equipped), then remove the plugin as normal.
Optionally, use ReSaver (or similar) to remove any leftover references in your save:

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Known Issues[/size][/color]
Parsing "LItemSpellTomesXXSchool" lists may not work if a mod adds any spell tome that doesn't belong to that school.
Unfortunately, this is a necessary constraint for proper performance when iterating (potentially very large) lists of spell tomes.

Revision History:
2.1.0 (2020-07-07):
-- Cancel writing tome if hands are sheathed after casting
-- Also fix casting time (0.5s instead of 0s, oops)
-- Also set UI art to something more interesting

2.0.0 (2019-07-13):
-- Major rewrite - significantly increased performance and compatibility via spell tome vendor LeveledItem list iteration (IMPORTANT NOTE: Any compatibility patches that alter "1foxFollowSpellTomeList" should be remade - there's a chance they won't even be needed now)
-- Add support for dual-cast-only spells by waiting at least 5 seconds, after which your most recently equipped spell will be used
-- Add more verbose in-game notifications for when a suitable spell tome can't be found, or when simply out of Dragon Souls

1.1.0 (2019-06-18):
-- Add DLC spells
-- Add proper menu marker (d'oh!)

r1:
-- Initial release.
