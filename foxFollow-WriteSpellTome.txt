Spell: Write Spell Tome
------
Implements the ability to write spell tomes from equipped spells in exchange for a Dragon Soul.

[h1][u]Skyrim Special Edition Note[/u][/h1]
[b]This will eventually make its way to SSE - I'll update this section when it does!
As it would require SKSE64, it would unfortunately be compatible with PC only.[/b]

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
Requires SKSE: http://skse.silverlock.org/

[h1]Usage[/h1]
Equip the Lesser Power "Write Spell Tome" in either hand, and a desired spell in the other hand.
After casting, the spell tome teaching that spell (if one exists) will appear in your inventory.

A Dragon Soul will be spent if a spell tome was successfully written; otherwise, nothing happens.

[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
Intended to be used with MFSTL to distribute otherwise unique, one-time spell tomes to followers:

However, this could just be used on its own if you otherwise had some use for writing spell tomes.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Currently, only vanilla spell tomes are supported.
For the merge-savvy, the FLST of supported Books is "1foxFollowSpellTomeList".

[h1]Uninstall Steps[/h1]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.
