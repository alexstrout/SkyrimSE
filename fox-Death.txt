[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Usage[/size][/color]
Upon taking fatal damage, a bleedout state is triggered for 20 seconds, similar to most followers.
If no nearby allies are left standing during this time, bleedout instead transitions to a defeat state.
If defeated, you are transported to a random nearby location, and all equipped gear is confiscated.

Upon revive, a stacking (20...80%) penalty to Magicka and Stamina regen is inflicted for 12 minutes.
However, a stacking (5/10...20%) experience bonus is also granted for the same duration.

Once those effects have expired, you may cast the Lesser Power "Echoes" to summon a spectral vendor.
This vendor allows you to individually purchase back your party's equipment, in exchange for gold.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Additional Information[/size][/color]
The bleedout effects may be skipped by simply resting 4 hours in-game (or 1 extra hour per stack).
However, since you can't rest near enemies, you may need resolve a bad situation first!

If defeated, pathfinding is used for transportation to avoid otherwise inaccessible locations.
Attempts are also made to avoid placing you into combat, retrying up to 3 times before giving up.
This relocation should work in any worldspace, and prefers your last visited exterior if indoors.

Beast transformations (e.g. Beast Form) will simply be reverted without a defeat scenario.
However, these are tricky to handle correctly; please see the Compatibility section below.

By default, the vendor will hang on to every item ever confiscated from your party.
This list may grow large over time; if you'd like to prune it, see the Configuration section below.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Configuration[/size][/color]
All options can be configured via the SkyUI Mod Configuration Menu!

However, you may also set these manually in the console (~ key):
[list][*][b]1foxDeathMaxDist[/b] - max ally "keep alive" distance when bleeding out [i](default 4096.0)[/i]
[*][b]1foxDeathMinReviveTime[/b] - minimum time to allow mods to revive the player [i](default 0.0)[/i]
[*][b]1foxDeathDifficulty[/b] - difficulty setting [i]-1 ... 2 (default 0)[/i][/list]
[list]	[i]-1[/i] = Easy - no changes on defeat[/list]
[list]	[i]0[/i] = Normal - clear vendor gold on defeat[/list]
[list]	[i]1[/i] = Hard - clear previously confiscated non-quest equipment on defeat (souls-ish)[/list]
[list]	[i]2[/i] = Brutal - clear all confiscated non-quest equipment on defeat[/list]
[list][*][b]1foxDeathAllowSellback[/b] - allow selling items back to vendor? [i]0/1 (default 0)[/i][/list]
Use "set [b]someVar[/b] to [i]someVal[/i]" to adjust these.
Use "help 1foxDeath 3" to see the current values on your save.
e.g. "set 1foxDeathDifficulty to 1" to set Hard mode difficulty.

Setting 1foxDeathMaxDist to 0 will result in defeat upon every bleedout.
Setting 1foxDeathMaxDist to -1 will completely disable the defeat scenario.

Easy / Normal have no applicable differences unless 1foxDeathAllowSellback is enabled.
While harder modes preserve quest items, other unique items may be lost! [b]Use with caution.[/b]

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]
Should be compatible with anything that isn't also a bleedout overhaul mod. (e.g. Death Alternate)
Should also work in any worldspace, DLC or modded.

Mods with bleedout mechanics might work, provided 1foxDeathMinReviveTime is enabled (see above).
For example, Wintersun's Arkayn Cycle can still revive you if this is set to 1 second or more.
However, if you're unsure, it is safest to leave this at 0 seconds (disabled, default).

Time-limited transformations (e.g. Beast Form and Vampire Lord) need special care to work correctly.
Mods that add these will need their controlling quest added to FLST "1foxDeathTransformationQuests".
(That quest must also follow the vanilla quest pattern of Stage 1 = Transform, Stage 100 = Revert)

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Uninstall Steps[/size][/color]
Type "stopquest 1foxDeathQuest" in console (~ key) to recover all items and remove all effects.
After, simply remove the plugin as normal.
Optionally, use ReSaver (or similar) to remove any leftover references in your save:

[b]Warning:[/b] If you don't recover all items before removing the plugin, they will be permanently lost.
[b]This may include quest items, which can permanently halt progress in your quests.[/b] Please avoid doing this!

Revision History:
1.3.0 (2024-xx-xx):
-- Echoes no longer requires 100 Magicka to cast. Instead, it sharply chunks both your Magicka and Stamina after casting - keeping that punch when communing with death, but being less annoying to actually cast.
-- Add some extra feedback on defeat by flopping over when actually dead.
-- Add new "1foxDeathMinReviveTime" option - if set to 0 (default), you can't be (accidentally) revived out of a bleedout state via healing. This fixes issues with mods that have more complex injury systems, such as Starfrost. Setting this to 0.1 seconds is roughly equal to v1.2.0's behavior.
-- Add SkyUI MCM support! Finally. :P

1.2.0 (2020-09-01):
-- Add new "1foxDeathAllowSellback" option - if disabled (default), you won't be able to "sell back" items to the vendor after purchasing your old equipment, as the vendor will no longer accrue gold from purchases. If enabled, everything functions identically to the previous v1.1.0 (you may sell back items to cover the cost of your old equipment).

1.1.0 (2020-07-07):
-- Grant a stacking (10...20%) experience bonus on revive - this bonus is halved if not fully defeated on bleedout (e.g. revive due to nearby friendlies).

1.0.0 (2020-06-18):
-- Initial release.
