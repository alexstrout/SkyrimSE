To Be Decided

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Requirements[/size][/color]
Requires SKSE64: [url=https://skse.silverlock.org]https://skse.silverlock.org[/url]

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Usage[/size][/color]
Simply get rekt as normal; upon taking fatal damage, a bleedout state is triggered for 20 seconds.
If no friendly actors are nearby during this time, bleedout instead transitions to a defeat state.

Upon revive, a stacking (20...80%) penalty to Magicka and Stamina regen is inflicted.
If defeated, you are also transported to a random location, and all equipped gear is confiscated.

Once that penalty has expired, you may cast the Lesser Power "Echoes" to summon a spectral vendor.
This vendor allows you to individually purchase back your party's equipment, in exchange for gold.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Additional Information[/size][/color]
The bleedout penalty may be skipped by simply resting 4 hours in-game (or 1 extra hour per stack).
However, since you can't rest near enemies, you may need resolve a bad situation first.

If defeated, pathfinding is used for transportation to avoid otherwise inaccessible locations.
Attempts are also made to avoid placing you into combat, retrying up to 3 times before giving up.

Beast transformations (e.g. Beast Form) will simply be reverted without a defeat scenario.
However, these are tricky to handle correctly; please see the Compatibility section below.

By default, the vendor will hang on to every item ever confiscated from your party.
This list may grow large over time; if you'd like to prune it, see the Configuration section below.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Configuration[/size][/color]
foxDeath comes with a few config variables:
[list][*][b]1foxDeathMaxDist[/b] - max ally "keep alive" distance when bleeding out [i](default 4096.0)[/i]
[*][b]1foxDeathDifficulty[/b] - difficulty setting [i]-1 ... 2 (default 0)[/i]
	[i]-1[/i] = Easy - no changes on defeat
	[i]0[/i] = Normal - clear vendor gold on defeat
	[i]1[/i] = Hard - clear previously confiscated non-quest equipment on defeat (souls-ish)
	[i]2[/i] = Brutal - clear all confiscated non-quest equipment on defeat[/list]
Type "set [b]someVar[/b] to [i]someVal[/i]" in console (~ key) to adjust config variables.
e.g. "set 1foxDeathDifficulty to 1" to set Hard mode difficulty.

Setting 1foxDeathMaxDist to 0 will result in defeat upon every bleedout.
Setting 1foxDeathMaxDist to -1 will completely disable the defeat scenario.

While harder modes preserve quest items, other unique items may be lost! [b]Use with caution.[/b]

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]
Should be compatible with anything that isn't also a bleedout overhaul mod. (e.g. Death Alternate)

Mods with limited bleedout scenarios should work, provided they revive the player within 6 seconds.
After 6 seconds, the defeat scenario may trigger, which could cause strange behavior.

Time-limited transformations (e.g. Beast Form and Vampire Lord) need special care to work correctly.
Mods that add these will need their controlling quest added to FLST "1foxDeathTransformationQuests".
(That quest must also follow the vanilla quest pattern of Stage 1 = Transform, Stage 100 = Revert)

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Uninstall Steps[/size][/color]
Type "stopquest 1foxDeathQuest" in console (~ key) to recover all items and remove all effects.
After, simply remove the plugin as normal.
Optionally, use ReSaver (or similar) to remove any leftover references in your save:

[b]Warning:[/b] If you don't recover all items before removing the plugin, they will be permanently lost. [b]This may include quest items, which can permanently halt progress in your quests.[/b] Please avoid doing this!
