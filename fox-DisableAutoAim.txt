No Auto-Aim
------
Disables archery auto-aiming.
------
Simply a port of my old (2012!) plugin from original Skyrim, included for completeness.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Additional Information[/size][/color]
Normally, Skyrim automatically aims your arrows toward enemies near your crosshair.
This plugin simply sets the auto-aim angles for ranged weaponry to zero, so that arrows always shoot where you're actually aiming.

Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.

(autoaim, auto aim, auto-aim, whatever)

Revision History:
r3:
-- Fixed the issue where follower commands (holding interact on your follower) wouldn't function, due to this plugin needlessly setting fAutoAimMaxDistance to 0. Credit for this fix goes to Ricochet Saw; check out his archery plugin here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=71452193

r2:
-- Unknown (probably a description update, which was needed from the CS at the time)

r1:
-- Initial release.
