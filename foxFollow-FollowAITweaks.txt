Follower AI Tweaks
------
Implements a number of tweaks to allow for smoother AI following in large groups.
------
Simply a port of my 2018 plugin from original Skyrim. Enjoy!

[b]Original Non-SE Version - Steam Workshop (1.4.0)[/b]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1416666894]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1416666894[/url]

[b]Additional Information[/b]
Tweaks the following GMSTs:
[list][*][b]fBumpReactionSmallDelayTime[/b]: 1.0 -> 0.25
[*][b]fBumpReactionSmallWaitTimer[/b]: 3.0 -> 0.75
	More responsive "move away" behavior when bumping into AI

[*][b]fAIMoveDistanceToRecalcFollowPath[/b]: 300.0 -> 64.0
[*][b]fFollowRunMaxSpeedupMultiplier[/b]: 1.25 -> 1.5
[*][b]fFollowRunMinSlowdownMultiplier[/b]: 0.75 -> 0.5
[*][b]fFollowStartSprintDistance[/b]: 500.0 -> 512.0
[*][b]fFollowWalkMinSlowdownMultiplier[/b]: 0.75 -> 0.5
	Smoother following at all ranges, particularly when walking

[*][b]fFollowMatchSpeedZoneWidth[/b]: 128.0 -> 1024.0
[*][b]fFollowSlowdownZoneWidth[/b]: 150.0 -> 128.0
	Helps prevent followers from crashing into you at extreme speeds

[*][b]fFollowerSpacingAtDoors[/b]: 200.0 -> 64.0
[*][b]fFollowSpaceBetweenFollowers[/b]: 192.0 -> 0.0
	Much smoother following with 2 or more followers

[*][b]fSummonedCreatureMaxFollowDist[/b]: 400.0 -> 512.0
[*][b]fSummonedCreatureMinFollowDist[/b]: 250.0 -> 256.0
	Match new PlayerFollwerPackage ranges below

[*][b]iNumberActorsAllowedToFollowPlayer[/b]: 6 -> 14
	Unsure, but MFSTL does allow 10 followers instead of 2, so bumped up by 8[/list]

Also tweaks PlayerFollowerPackage:
[list][*][b]Max Radius[/b]: 384.0000 -> 512.0000
	Smoother following behavior (when combined with above)[/list]

The above tweaks primarily apply to recruited followers, and may or may not apply to quest followers on a case-by-case basis (they typically use all sorts of different AI packages).

[b]Compatibility[/b]
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't also tweak the above GMSTs or PlayerFollowerPackage.
Should work in any multi-follower mod that uses (but doesn't alter) PlayerFollowerPackage.
However, in case of conflict, whichever is loaded later (below) will simply take precedence.

[b]Uninstall Steps[/b]
Simply remove the plugin as normal; no save cleaning necessary.

Revision History:
1.4.1 (2019-06-24):
Fixed issue with bad FormIDs, due to adding additional Game Setting (GMST) records to the ESL-ified plugin without running "Compact Active File Form IDs" again (oops!). The OG Skyrim 1.4.0 version on Steam Workshop was not affected by this issue.

r5:
(changes downported from SE version)
-- Major adjustments, with much smoother following (and less crashing into your horse)

r4:
-- Reverted [b]Maintain Speed at Goal[/b] in PlayerFollowerPackage back to False.

r3:
-- Oops

r2:
-- Flipped [b]Random conversations[/b] in PlayerFollowerPackage back to False. Repeatedly chatty groups could start to get a little annoying!
-- Flipped [b]Maintain Speed at Goal[/b] in PlayerFollowerPackage to True - the default of False appears to cause conflicts in their pacing when nearing the player, particularly if the player is running.
-- Decreased [b]fFollowStartSprintDistance[/b] to 384 (default 500), to be more in line with new following distances and remain closer to player when navigating complex routes.

r1:
-- Initial release.
