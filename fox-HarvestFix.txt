Skyrim has an annoying bug where harvested plants don't respawn when loading a save game.
This is covered in great detail on the following mod pages:

wiseman303 wrote a [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/50547]Technical Details[/url] article explaining in more detail how these fixes worked.

Brutal Flora Harvest Fix takes a different approach - attaching a script "hook" to ObjectReference.

A modified ObjectReference script inserts a single function call into each of the following events:
[list][*][b]OnActivate[/b] - to store our last harvest time (into a single new float value).
[*][b]OnCellAttach[/b] - to fix any references last harvested more than 10 days ago.[/list]
The inserted calls first check SKSE's native IsHarvested function to see if any work is required.

This has some advantages:
[list][*]It is universally compatible with any harvestable object in the game, vanilla or modded.
[*]It is retroactive on existing saves, and may also be safely uninstalled at any time.
[*]It is efficient, with any reference's OnCellAttach hook only firing once per save load.
[*]It is lightweight, making no permanent changes to references or adding any event registrations.
[*]Like other harvest fixes, it decouples harvest respawning from cell resets.[/list]

And also some disadvantages:
[list][*]It only applies after a cell change (due to the scope of available events to the script).
[*]It adds a (negligible?) script overhead to the otherwise empty hooked events.
[*]It would need an update if SKSE's ObjectReference.pex script ever changes (it hasn't in years).
[*]The OnCellAttach hook can fail on references to null forms, dumping an error to Papyrus log.
	(This seems harmless as the default OnCellAttach event would otherwise be empty anyway)
[*]In certain rare cases, it's possible to miss updating a reference's mesh (see [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1287]script source[/url]).
[*]It's still not as clean as a native SKSE plugin could be. :P[/list]

Defaults to a 10-day respawn time (Skyrim's default cell reset time).
However, alternate 3-day, 30-day, and instant respawn time versions are included in the download.
(Respawn time may be further customized via editing foxHarvestFix.psc and recompiling the script)

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't also replace SKSE's ObjectReference.pex script.
Technically compatible with other harvest fixes? But flora/fauna may respawn sooner than desired.

[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Uninstall Steps[/size][/color]
Simply replace the following with SKSE's original files:
[list][*]Data\Scripts\objectreference.pex
[*]Data\Scripts\Source\ObjectReference.psc[/list]
And remove the following:
[list][*]Data\Scripts\foxHarvestFix.pex
[*]Data\Scripts\Source\foxHarvestFix.psc[/list]

Should be safe to uninstall from saves at any time; no save cleaning necessary.

Revision History:
1.1.0 (2019-07-31):
-- Use 10-day default respawn time
-- Add optional 3-day, 30-day, and instant respawn time versions (in a single zip)
-- Spread out SetHarvested calls a little more, to further reduce the (rare) chance of not updating a plant mesh's harvest state
-- Tiny optimization to fix the triple float-int-float cast on GetFormID when spreading out the SetHarvested calls (oops)

1.0.0 (2019-07-28):
-- Initial release.
