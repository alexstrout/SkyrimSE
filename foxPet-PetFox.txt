Simple Pet Fox - Kitt and Sola
------
Adds Kitt and Sola, two simple pet foxes, to Dragonsreach.
------
Simply a port of my old (2012!) plugin from original Skyrim. Enjoy!

[b]Original Non-SE Version - Steam Workshop (1.14.0)[/b]

[b]Usage[/b]
Simply approach and talk to either fox, and they'll be recruited into your party.
If you already have an animal following, that animal will be dismissed.
Either fox will return to Dragonsreach when dismissed, and can be recruited again at any time.

[b]Additional Information[/b]
Both foxes level with the player to 50, like other vanilla followers.
They otherwise have normal stats, but are marked as essential (bleedout state at 0 health).

Kitt, the red fox, is the bolder of the two and tanks Dragons like a champ.
Sola, the snow fox, is less aggressive, but possesses a snow fox's normal frost resistance.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
Should be compatible with just about anything, regardless of load order.
Should work in any multi-follower mod that supports vanilla animal followers.

[b]Optional Plugins[/b]
By default, foxes have rather annoying idle breathing sounds, but can be silenced using this plugin:
(TODO link to follow!)

To command both foxes at once (with catch-up / teleport functionality), try MFSTL:
(TODO link to follow!)
(Note: Foxes can not learn spells - I couldn't figure out how to define animations to cast them!)

[b]Uninstall Steps[/b]
Simply dismiss any fox present in your party, then remove the plugin as normal.
Optionally, use ReSaver (or similar) to remove any leftover references in your save:

[b]Known Issues[/b]
The bleedout state on animals is a little weird - since they have no bleedout animations, they will appear to just sit there in an idle combat state. However, they will eventually become active again, like normal followers.

Very rarely, one or both foxes won't spawn inside Dragonsreach. I'm currently unsure why this happens, but it can be worked around by saving and restarting the game, after which they will appear as expected.

Revision History:
r14:
(changes downported from SE version)
-- Improved script documentation
-- Don't immediately drop projectiles we've just been shot with (these will instead fall back to old behavior of transferring to the player next time we chat, to keep inventory clean)

r13:
-- Fixed very minor script goof
-- Set 1foxPetRace HP regen to playable races' default of 0.7

r12:
-- Minor script cleanup

r11:
-- Improved compatibility with multi-follower frameworks (activating a fox no longer attempts to add it to the party if its "teammate" status is already set, or if it already has available dialogue)
-- Fixed script's "None" PlayerRef on old saves (script will fix if necessary upon activating a fox)
-- Added in-game messages for any necessary updating done via script (e.g. for the above change)

r10:
-- Fix vanilla SetAnimal / DismissAnimal scripts forcing pet's lockpicking ability to 0 (doesn't really matter? But nice to fix)
-- Fix overriding Stray Dog dialogue with generic *blank stare* (oops!)
-- Small script code cleanups, particularly with "picking up" dropped items (and immediately dropping them again)
(Note: There is a vanilla bug where items taken by followers are sometimes marked as stolen. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fix this.)

r9:
-- Fixed a minor (but longstanding) issue where foxes could be issued orders after being released from the party, due to the dialog scripts not being packaged into the BSA archive (oops!)

r8:
-- Fixed issue where foxes could get stuck bleedout (vanilla bug)
-- Fixed issue where foxes could get stuck in a combat state after combat ended because of bleedout (vanilla bug)
-- Both foxes should more reliably wander around Dragonsreach when not in the player's party

r7:
-- Automatic bleedout fix in case the foxes do get stuck in bleedout state (no need to zone / manually fix / etc.)
-- Foxes can now be given orders like normal human followers, because they're sharp. If pointed at a chest / cupboard / etc. they will happily toss everything inside all over the floor, making a huge mess.
-- Old pets are now properly dismissed when adding a fox as a follower (broke this in r6 - whoops!)

r6:
-- Code cleanup in scripts
-- Partial fix for "broken bleedout" state (still bleeding out even though IsBleedingOut returns false) - activating a fox in a broken bleedout state will reset it

r5:
-- When activating a fox that is not in your party, it will now kick your old pet (useful if you have a "lost" stray dog etc.)
-- Added more useful messages when activating a fox ("Kitt has joined your party.", etc.)

r4:
-- Removed needless Update.esm master (nothing from any updates have been used or modified)
-- Fixed "You already have a pet." message displaying when trying to activate either fox in bleedout state.

r3:
-- Removed ArmorAddon entries; the fox companion race now directly copies morph/armor data from FoxRace. Will now be compatible with any plugin that modifies these entries.
-- Buffed damage by 60% (matches dogs now)

r2:
-- Added Sola, a snow fox
-- A message is now displayed if you can't take a fox because you already have a pet

r1:
-- Initial release.
